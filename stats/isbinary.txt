These stats are for isBinary function. It only allows non-assignment binary
operators. This function happens right after parsing assignments. The first
time it will never encounter an assignment, but it's possible (though in
error) to encounter them afterwards.

Just to repeat: these stats are not for "binary operators" in general!

These are some stats of the 16mb bench file:

identifier happens about 0.5% of the time
punctuator is 99.5%
no other token has been found (is that even possible without error?)

len=1: 93%
len=2: 5%
len=3: 1%
len>3: nearly 1%

the function returns false in 86% of the calls
